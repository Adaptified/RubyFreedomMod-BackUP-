The RubyFreedomMod is currently a fork from **FreedomOPMod**, for Bukkit server's who want a All-OP server. You can see the RubyFreedom Fourms at http://rubyfreedom.boards.net/ And you can see the TFM Github here. http://github.com/TotalFreedom/totalfreedommod If you have any problems ask our devs and our helpers. Our Dev support is here, http://to.fop.us.to/devsupport. Feel free to commit. Also, there won't be any public distributed releases just yet for the DaPancake & ThePheonixblader RBFM. Please watch the RubyFreedom Boards for more info.
